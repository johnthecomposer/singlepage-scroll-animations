# singlepage-scroll-animations

Simple animations and effects linked with scrolling, using different methods: jQuery, CSS, and custom JavaScript functions.

- the header starts fixed at the bottom of the screen, moves up with scroll, and becomes fixed again upon reaching the top
- when a <section> comes into view, 
  - its background image fades in
  - an overlay with a border and section title moves from left to right, framing the image on completion
